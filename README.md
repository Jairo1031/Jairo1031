### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jay!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new skills to further excel in my field of expertise. With a focus on software development, I am honing my skills in API Testing, Node.js, React.js, and implementing design patterns like Block Element Modifier (BEM) to create scalable and maintainable web applications.

Additionally, I'm also exploring the latest trends and best practices in front-end development, including Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and HTML. As a tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in JavaScript, I strive to enhance my abilities to craft engaging and user-friendly web interfaces.

Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and growth, and I believe that staying up-to-date with cutting-edge technologies is crucial in today's fast-paced tech landscape. By combining my skills in API Testing, Node.js, React.js, BEM, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, I aim to create innovative software solutions that deliver seamless user experiences and address complex challenges in the ever-evolving world of web development.
